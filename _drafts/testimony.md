I came to know the Lord by experiencing the love other believers shown to me in high school when I first came to America. My brother and I, 14 and 15 years old at the time, came to the US by ourselves; and without any relatives or prior friends, the local church families took us in.

It used to always perplex me how these families were so kind and open in inviting me into their daily lives. Not only so, always willing to go out of their way to support my brother and I.

However, I only start understanding the love these families posses after going to college and eventually got connected into communities. Further, it took time and learning of the Word through clearer lens such as The Perspectives Course, and GMC One (renamed to DMI now) to understand the depth of Jesus's love and the calling of fulfilling the great commission.

Now I am more equipped to feed myself and learn how to obey Jesus instead of obeying the laws.
