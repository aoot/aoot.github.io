## Understanding Starwars
After today, I finally have a better grasp of what is going on with Starwars. The order of which the movies were shot definitly made the storyline even more convoluted, especially that most of the movies I've watched prioer to 2010 were with Chinese subtitles, and understood through the subtitles. Now thinking about it, a lot of the references and undertones of the movies were not fully translated and communicated in the subtitles. Which prompts a good reason to re-watch all the movied I've watched prioer to 2010, espeically those good ones! (If I got the time to do so!)

## The Force as the Divine
"I am one with the force and the force is with me" was repeated quite a few times and has been shown to provide assurance to some of the characters in the movie. Thus I got curious as to what The Force is and how it relates to the Jedi; and also trying to understand what the Jedis are. Were they an order or a ranking of which invidiuals were born into?

"May the Force be with you" was referenced as the current day saying of "May god be with you" or "May God bless you". Especialy the setting of a desert, and mention of Citadel, I can't help wondering if there were any analogy or reference to the Bible; and continuously amazed at how much things have or have potential reference to the Bible that I never knew or understood.

## Hope
During the conversation with my buddy to understand what the heck "The Force" is, through examples that he has given, it seems that The Force seems to be a divine authority that was not personified. In the Starwards movies, if the "Force" were to be substituded with "destiny," there wouldn't be much issue in understanding the plotline. In comparison, the Jedi is an order that seeks to align itself with such divine authrotiy, but also subjected to the desires and natural of human. The example of when the dice was tossed to decided whether Anakin Skywalker gets to be free, or be free with his mom during if he were to win the race, the Jedi used his power to manipulate the dice intentionally so that Anakin is forced to leave his mother. The logic being that kin can cause distraction in the training of this powerful Jedi, and if Anakin were to learn to tap into the emotions of a loss this great and painful, he can multiply his potential and power.

I made the arguement that Anakin may never turn out to be Darth Vader if the Jedi were to let the dice run it's course according to The Force, or Destiny. 

## Summary
The conversation was definitely enlightening and made Starwars seem to have so much more depth than what I thought it had, or understood. Yet, there seems to have quite a few layers and levels of complexities in the story and may have reference to the Bible. Thus, I am now very interested to learn and undersatnd the storyline of Starwars, and inspiration of the original creator in creating the Starwars SAGA.
