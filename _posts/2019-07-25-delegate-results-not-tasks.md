## Results Driven

Team members often complain that "being measured" is a very inpersonal way of evaluating a person's performance. Not only so, it ignores the quality component that is often involved with the person's performance.

Indeed, measurements are very impersonal, but also objective. How would one be able to compare anything if there isn't a benchmark, a standard, or a rule? Life as well, there are so much things that we can measure ourselves against. The culture, celebrity values, or maybe a fictional culture that is confined in a television show! Is it a standard if there are multiples of them?

My learning today, or realization, was that I have been busy delegating reults, and found a really good system to keep track of them. However, they soon grew beyond my bandwidth as I have twelve team member to support, not considering the others, such as end-users, stakeholders, partners, other internal team members, etc. Soon, I realized I am not able to do the work for twelve people, then the mindset becomes learning how to empower and teach them, training them to become me, and thus free-ing me up to focus on where my strength is, and figure out how I can add value to the team.

This is not to say that all will be delegated to them, but delegating the results, and when communicating, communicating a result instead of a task. In such way, the other person(s) would be able to provide their unique perspective and experience into the problem solving process, thus truly create a collaborative teamwork dynamic.

I believe at a low level I understood that, and have been speaking about that, but have yet to truly incorporate that into my influence sytle, nor the way I think and manage myself, for a matter of fact.

In reflection, I realized that I seem to have overloaded my mental space with tasks after tasks that have gradually numbed me and cause slothness. This giant task list eventually became so daunting that not even one is completed.

However, what I should've done instead is to define the result/goal that I wanted to achieve, understand the edge cases and parameters, formualte tasks within the parameters, then focus on the result, but execute the tasks! Not focus on the tasks and forget the big picture!

With all the being said, I have restructured my organization to track results, isntead of tasks. Of course, there is still tasks under each results/goals, but such way I am reminded of the goal that I'm striving for each time I check and organize my table, thus allowing course-correction if I later realize any of the mis-alignment of the tasks.
