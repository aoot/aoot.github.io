## 3 Kinds of Powers 
Recently I was reminded of the 3 kinds of powers, the Positional, Relational, and Expertise Power.
In addition, I realized one of the strengths and weaknesses of my usual thinking process, and I call it the unchecked creative thinking.

These two insights stemmed from the reflection of some of the things I've experienced in the business world, but lack the language and vocabulary to synthesize them into communicatable and useful bites of insights. Further, I realized the need of greater periods of reflection and synthesis instead of documentation and gathering of data.

### Positional Power
Positional power is a top-down power dynamic originated from title, budget, headcount. It is usually an assigned power with authortiy. Examples are Chairman > CEO > President > Senior Vice President > Vice President > Director > Manager > Individual contributor.

### Relational Power
Relational power is the primary currency of whatever involves humans, of which is something that I have always overlooked and perceived as incompatible with large organization. I still remember the debate I had with a country manager of a large telecommunication company that large corporations are supposed to be well desgined machinery that runs at high levels of efficiencies. Of course, what do I know about humans being social creatures and the relationship dynamics required to get things done compared to a high level executive of a large corporation; for the record, that debate was a learning lesson for me.

This understanding took me years even till now to gradually accept and understand that humans are relational creatures, and creatures of high cognitive capacity [= emotions]. Thus when there are humans, there exists the need for influence and reciprocity [even with family].

### Expertise Power
This power explains itself. Would you rather trust something who went to Johns Hopkins Medical School instead of xxx High School to diagnose some symptoms that have been keeping you up all those nights?

## Conclusion
In conclusion, having an understanding of the different powers observed in regular human interactions provides a way of navigating the squishy inter-human [yes, third person] dynamics. And, different weightings of each of the powers are required in different situations.

### Expertise Power
