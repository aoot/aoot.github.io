## What is my job description

Being so used to the startup environment, of which each member wears multiple hats, often seemingly unrelated role, I am used to the vague job description. I thought that working in a team would mean the same thing too, that none of the people on the team, or at leaset most of the people on the team would not have a mutually exclusive responsibility. Thinking back to the college days of which each person on a team project just fades into a role, and those who cares more about the result or the grade of the project would gradually assume the leader role of taking charge and guiding or pushing the direction of the project. Or perhaps, doing most of the work.

Such idea challenges my understand of leadership and management. Neither of them is truly leading from the front or back, but a combination of both depending on the situation and need. Additionally, each of the team member on the team would be influenced and guided differently. Some are motivated by recognition, some by monetary rewards, and some thrive on the mastery of a skill, etc. There is not a one size fits all, but there is a vision and direction that fits all to make sure each person is rowing in the same direction, however, the way of which they row can vary. Some row with the oar, some with hands, and some choose to even test new innovative methods out. Yet, at the end of the day, they all are contributing to the direction of where the baot is pointed to.

So, my job description is quite vague. Tasked to grow the business in a specific segment and way, but given a liberal range of liberty to try different methods and incorporate one's own experience and spin on it. /[Side thought that just popped up, the higher leadership of my organization is not very visible!/] How Todd, Mae, Brian, and other folks who are much more tenured have explained each of our operations as running an 5 million business operations. Fortunately, there has been momentum before we stepped in, but just like a CEO that was hired in to achieve a task, he/she is now tasked to understand the business and bridge the gap between the current situation and objective.

Although most of the days we feel as if we are innudated with daily tasks after tasks, but for progress to be made on the business and also self-learning, one has to step back and look at the organization, market, supply chain, economy, politics, industries, etc. as a whole to strategize and figure out directions.

## Figuring out the direction

Thus, we not only don't have a clear job description, but we do have one clear objective, to grow the business in ways of revenue and net-new acquisition.

I've heard multiple times from different individuals refering to our segment and business unit as among the toughest jobs in the entire company; because we are given objective but not goal, and one has to find the path and daily rhythm themselves; and I am still finding out the path and strategy of treading the path to reach the peak of the mountain.

It is sort of flattering to hear such comment, but being in the trenches, I can easily forget how fortunate I am be at where I am and do what I do. It really is not something I did, as everything I did was built on the foundation of God's grace and gifts, and other's investments into my life (esp. my parents). So what is my true direction? My true direction is following God and Jesus, and loving others. But how do I work hard, and stay on God's path without letting this other thing (work) that I've invested so much of my time and energy to become the definition of who I am?
