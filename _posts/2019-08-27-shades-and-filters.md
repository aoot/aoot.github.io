## Shades and Filters
What are the filters that we look through in our daily lives? Today, on my way out of my office, being exhausted and having coming into the office early and now leaving late, I was thinking to myself: "How have I been living for the glory of God? What if I drop dead right now, at the parking lot of my office? First, there will be a lot of interesting gossip, which I would be very interested in listening in. Second, I would not have called myself following Jesus, because the most I did was to keep my head down and try not to be burried by my work."

There is a lot of work backlogged right now unfortunately.

So, I have been looking through the worldly lens of value, success, and purpose of life. To be a diligent employee (to the point of sacraficing your personal time and well being), deliver exponential growth in my business segment (at the cost of "creative" story telling), and to be a contribution to society, else, I'm not valauble.

## Shades
Shades are things one chooses not to see, or potentially don't know they don't see. Most common is the stories and feelings of others. At a corporation this huge, it is so easy to keep you heads down so that you won't have to exchange plesantries for five times on your way to the restroom, or refill that third cup of coffee at 10:30am.

How can one truly understands a person without hearing out their story? How can one truly be understood without sharing their own story? We assume others can read minds as we are so self-obsessed with ourselves because we are our entire world, as we only perceive what we see and hear.

## Filters
Realized that I wrote it above, so I'm going to skip because I really like to reflect on the last part.

## Speck in your eye
Luke 6:42
How can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me take out the speck that is in your eye,’ when you yourself do not see the log that is in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother’s eye.

I found this verse very facinating for various reasons.
- How does one know that the log in my eye has been taken out? Is it ever taken out?
- Isn't it kind that this person at least offered to take the speck out instead of just sitting on the high throne critically commenting about the dust in the other's eyes.
- To be continued, I'm sleepy...
