## Being a Team Player
People often ask, "are you a team player?", "what is an example of you exemplifying yourself as a team player?"


For most of the time, I have a hard time articulating my answer to similar questions of such. At least, I did not quite understand or have fully experienced the aspect of being a team player. OR, the experience just wasn't as revelational as my learning over the past few months being with this new organization within Dell, working out the creases of being a new business unit, and figuring out how to jump on the train of my team, that has already been running at full speed forever.

Along with this concept of "being a team player", were the ideas of "manager v leader", "tasks(activities) v results", "managing time v managing attention", etc. However, those are for another topic, and I am sidetracking here.

Being a team player, I've experienced recently, has been not only results driven, but also relationship focused, strength focused. There is a value of having face-to-face time and also time working alongside each other. This builds trust, and relationship among the team, and facilitates the understanding of each other's strengths. From a personal perspective, there has to be an active speaking up and courage to spread your wings to showcase or testout the water-of-your-competencies.

So gradually, I've learned to work with both teams that I work on a daily basis together; my colleague team (managed by the same manager), and the team I support (which is also remote in a different state). The dynamic of each is different, further, the dynamic between each person within each team is also different. Thus, how does one lead with inspiration, guide with gentleness, empower with love, and execute with wisdom?
