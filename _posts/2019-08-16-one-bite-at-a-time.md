## How do you eat an elephant?

One bite at a time. Progress and trends are different. Progress incorporates part of the future uncertainties, and trends is all and only history. When progress is slow, tracking it provides encouragement and accountability of what you're doing. Additionally, if you don't track anything you're doing, you would never be able to measure it.

However, don't let tracking progress draw you into analysis paralysis, which is very common for myself. Having just enough information to decrease the uncertainty is more than enough, especially when forecasting into the future. There are way too many uncertain variables to make certain of the future.

## What progress did I make?

My goal is now to take one step at a time, while breaking down the whole goal and contantly comparing the results from top-down and bottoms-up analysis. Bottoms-up, I am making two new small acquisitions per day in the sense of progress, that hopefully leads to account acquisitions. Top-down, I need much more traction than two small acquisitions per day.

## Summary Report
- -5 Relationship and People
- +1 Result/Outcome focused
- +2 Inbox zero

This reporting framework will iterate and get better!
