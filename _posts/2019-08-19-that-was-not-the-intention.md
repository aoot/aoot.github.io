## Calling Out
> Let's make sure we call out those that have begun the process of getting their leads actioned.
We had some fun today when Anthony forgot people have feelings and business is a giant team effort, team requires people, and people have feelings. 
Here is what happened.

Usually, I am tasked to brief the team over how we are tracking regarding the progress of lead action and conversion to potential opportunities. Just like any other organizations, there has to be an input funnel, and the input funnel requires filtering/qualifying to be able to hone down and prioritize. Thus, we are putting a greater emphasis on making sure that the leads are being worked on with a consistent pace, else, towards the end of the cadence cycle, there are no time allowed for the clients to react or even worse, for the value of our service/product to be realized.

Being gold-fish memory is so prevalent when there are 100 things pulling you in all four directions, I forgot about the reporting that I needed to pull and filter. My manager, did it for me, and even blurped the talking points on the top of the screenshot he emailed me! How can that go wrong right?

Remember how Jeff Bezo requires his board to read through the length agenda, similar to the size of a novel, before the meeting and come ready for questions and inputs? I DID NOT READ THE EMAIL before the meeting, and didn't discover it until my my manager (BD) pointed it out when it was my turn to present... Guess what I did?! Without projecting my screen to the conference call nor the board in the conference room, I went through the list and called out all the individuals by name who needed to improve. I called my team members out by name.

In my mind, it makes perfect sense for such kind of transparency. The bluntness required in a standup meeting so that the team can come together and problem solve as a group with the goal to move everyone forward. Indeed, the level of transparency would work more fitting in small startup environments of scrapiness, however in businesses, there seems to be nicities that needs to be observed.

I didn't feel offended by this, however, it was a great revelation to me that what I thought was great turns out to be a little diminishing to my own team member. Oops.

## Reflection
- +3 Staying active
- +2 DNT
- +2 Focused </p>
- -5 Fitting work into God's plan instead of fitting God into work!
- -2 Organization
  - Can improve on organization to keep track of what is needed and requested of me on a recurring basis during each week instead of relying on a single hiearchy of task list with categorizations (in Outlook).
- -1 Work life balance, coming on time, and leaving on time. </p>
- (Would like to) +1 Discipline
